Code Quality:

This class is kept simple, and contains only the necessary information, 
such as animation frames and horizontal position. There is low coupling,
since this class only depends upon classes defined in the XNA framework.
In addition, there is high cohesion, since the class encapsulates all
logic for maintaining a moving cloud in the background.

The constructor for this class only contains three parameters, so it can be
used from many other classes with the proper information. In addition, these
parameters enable multiple types of clouds to be constructed with this class,
since the parameters are not tied to a specific spritesheet format.

Hypothetical change:

I am not currently familiar with how the background interface is going to
properly render background elements. However, unless IBackground is necessary
for all background elements, interfaces or abstract classes could be created
to render groups of background items (ICloud, IBush, etc).
