Comments: All in all, a very readable and efficient class. The only thing to consider
is changing 'isMovingRight' from an integer to a boolean value since it only has two
possible states. 

Hypothetical Change: Right now, Mario can only be supported as a large mario state. If
the game was to follow exactly as world 1-1 does, small mario state would not be possible
under this implementation.
