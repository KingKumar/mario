Code Quality:

Number of Lines per method is reasonably well under readable length.
Coupling with other classes in the game is low. There is no method or class
that modifies the internal field of this class. 
Dependency is moderate:
    -Depend on the Textures when first initiated
    -Depend on other texture information from the constructor parameter
Cyclomatic complexity
Complexity for method Update() M = 4(Edges) - 4(NOdes) + 2(exit nodes) = 2
Update method contains only one switch statement where it has 2 states
Overall quality is good and easy to understand

Hypothetical change:
Since it is a static(not meant in programming way, more like just a sprite
and not much function involved with it) 
sprite class we can load the content inside the constructor 
rather than getting it from parameter. However to do this we have to give Game1 game
as a parameter. This modification will make things a bit cleaner in the game
code. 
Since it is a static sprite in the future there will not be much of change
with it and even if it changes flexibility is good, since there is low
coupling with other class
