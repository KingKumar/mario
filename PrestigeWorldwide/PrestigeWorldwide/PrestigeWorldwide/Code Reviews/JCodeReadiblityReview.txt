Comments:
Readability:
    -Code is very well written
    -Very easy to follow the logical flow of the code
    -Variable names are self explanatory
Not very well readable:
    -Overal everything looks good, maybe contains a lot of fields
     but since it is a sprite class so there is not much thing to avoid 
     these fields
