Code Quality Review:
	- Number of line in the code is long 
	- Coupling is high, it calls methods from everything that has collision
		and calls respective action for collision, However one centralized 
		collision manager can be easy to maintian. 
	- Cohesion is low

Hypothetical change:
	We could separate the different object's collision into separate classes.
	Such as putting enemy collision logic in one class and mario's collision in one class
	and mario's projectiles in another class etc.
