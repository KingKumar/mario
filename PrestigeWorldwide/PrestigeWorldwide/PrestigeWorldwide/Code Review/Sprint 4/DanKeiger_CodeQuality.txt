Trap.cs
Robert Feeney
Comments: Very good improvement from previous code implementations - very readable and 
has appropriate naming conventions; no magic numbers. Comments are also not overused and
not redundant.
Code Improvment: This code cannot lock a position after Mario moves right (mario can still 
move backward to previous areas of the map) If changes in enemy states were to be based off
of camera position, this camera/trap system would not be functional.
