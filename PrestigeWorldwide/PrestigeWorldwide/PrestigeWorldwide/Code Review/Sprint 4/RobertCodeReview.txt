Name of file being reviewed: Level.cs

Comments: Cohesion is high for level.cs.  All of the overhead instantation, updating and drawing for a level run through this class.  Coupling is very high for this class.  Nearly every other class will call to level.cs at one point or another.
Most of this coupling can be justified, as level is a container class, but it code could be moved around to reduce at least some of the coupling.  Commenting could be reduced.  ANy need for a comment could be handeled as a method instead.

Suggestion: perhaps create a subclass that handles passing values between enemies,items and mario
