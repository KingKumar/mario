Code Quality 
	-Class length a little long
	-No branching, easy to maintain
	-crowded, repetative code
	-Start menu cohesion is strong
	-High coupling with level class(no avise at this time on how to lower this)

Hypothetical Change
	-Instead of redecorating the start menu, seperate the Game over menu into an independant class altogether
	-this will remove some clutter crom StartMenu.cs, improve cohesion, and reduce coupling with level.cs
