Readability Review
	-Naming convention is easily understandable
	-Code is a linear, no branching, good 
	-Code length is short, however everything is loaded in at the 
	 same time it makes it a little bit harder to distinguish 

Hypothetical Change
	-Grouping the lines in the class, like all enemy texture are consequent 
	followed by a space and all item texture so on.
