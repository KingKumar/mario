Readability Review
	-Each block of code is easily understandable as to what its purpose is
	-as more options are added to menu, repetative code is cluttering the file
	-lack of modular coding is making the file longer than neccesary

Hypothetical Change
	-Move all keystroke checks to a start menu controller and run through command classes 
	this will remove clutter from the Start menu file
