Code Quality 
	-Class length is short
	-No branching, easy to maintain
	-Little crowded, too many variables
	-Cohesion is good, all methods are related to UI
	-Coupling, moderate, calls other class to generate objects
	 It is required, since only Game1 class can load texture2D and level class knows 
	 the current place to draw.

Hypothetical Change
	-We could sub class the texture classes such as item UI, enemy UI, backgroudn UI .. etc
