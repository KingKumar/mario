Readability:
	-Code is very easy to read and understand what every function is doing
	-Good descriptive function names, so the file is easy to read without comments
	-Another positive is the class only needs to be coupled with the mario class and current level class
	-Room for improvement as far as functionality but strong cohesion

Hypothetical Change
	-This would most likely be working backwards, but one change could be to move this logic into the mario class
	 so that the mario class would only have to be coupled with the CollisionManager to handle mario collisions
