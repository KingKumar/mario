Code Quality Review
	-Class has a lot of instance fields, however since it controls
	 all sounds it is necessary
	-Also contains all the sound methods that appear in the game
	-Cyclomatic complexity is 1, there is no branching or conditional
	-Coupling with other class is high, since all the other object 
	 that has sound calls its method
	-Logical and funcitonal cohesion is high, all the sounds methods 
	 grouped under this class

Hypothetical Change
	-Maybe creating subclass categorizing sounds into background, mario
	 sounds, enemy sounds etc.
