Comments: This file is a very small class so it is initially inherently readable.  A quick glance at the code gives a good idea
	of its functionality, so it is very readable.  Good names for each field and function.  Also, each level.spriteBatch.DrawString()
	method is decently clear as to what it is specifically drawing to the screen.
	However, the level.spriteBatch.DrawString() methods could be refactored to be more clear as to everything that they are
	specifically doing.  Also, there are some magic numbers that could be made into constants.
