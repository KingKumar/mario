Readability:
	-Short length (under 100 lines)
	-Easy to read and understand
	-Intuitive variable names
	-Very simple logic
	-Highly cohesive with level
	-Loosely coupled with all other classes

Hypothetical Change
	-Game is being passed for the sole purpose of changing background color
		-Might want to reconsider how background color is dependent on game (switch to level)
	-Consider adding mute sound in pause? (opinion: music gets annoying after awhile)
