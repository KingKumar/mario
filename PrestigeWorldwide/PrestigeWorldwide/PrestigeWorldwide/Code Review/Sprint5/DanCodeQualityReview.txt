Flag.cs

Code quality is good, however, you have several magic number with no context as to what they represent. Additionally,
the flag is implemented as a background object, which ideally should not be associated in the backgroundfactory as it complicates
the final animation.
Hypthetical Change: What if the flag is around other background objects? The other objects would overlay and the flag would not be visible
