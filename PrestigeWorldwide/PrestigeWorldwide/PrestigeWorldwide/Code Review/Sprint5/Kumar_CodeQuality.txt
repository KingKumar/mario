Code Quality Review
	-Class is very cohesive in accomplishing its task of providing a UI once Mario dies
	-Coupling with level is high, Coupling with game is low and almost unnecesary 
		-Game is passed for the sole purpose of loading content, but this seems to be the best way
	-Code length under 100 lines, this is good

Hypothetical Change
	-A lot of magic numbers. Move these to the Static Values folder
