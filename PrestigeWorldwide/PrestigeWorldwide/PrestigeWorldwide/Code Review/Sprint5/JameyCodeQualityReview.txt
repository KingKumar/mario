Trap.cs (Dan Keiger)

Comments:
	Coupled to Level, but this is okay since Level connects most classes
	directly / indirectly. Since only coupled to Mario, this is low coupling. 
	Also, this class is high cohesion since its sole purpose is to create
	a frame around Mario for camera scrolling.

Hypothetical change:
	Perhaps move the location parameter from the constructor and instead have
	a value that is mutable from other referencing classes.
