Comments:
	This class looks clean, and it is easy to see what is going on. In addition,
	the code has a very specific purpose that others are able to understand.
	However, there are some hard-coded coordinates that could be made into variables
	or perhaps provided by some other class. Overall, concise and easy to understand.
