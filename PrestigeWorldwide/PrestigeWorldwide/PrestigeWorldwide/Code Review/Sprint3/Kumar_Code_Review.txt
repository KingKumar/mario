File Reviewed: CSVParser.cs
Author of code: Dan Keiger
Comments:	This class is highly cohesive as it only focuses on accomplishing one goal- parsing an input
			CSV and notifying the user what objects are to be placed based on the input file. This class
			is very robust and can be used repeatedly and reliably. The code is also very easy to understand.
			No comments are needed as every line of code is inutitive. 
			This class relies on no other file other than the input CSV. Thus, this class has low coupling.
