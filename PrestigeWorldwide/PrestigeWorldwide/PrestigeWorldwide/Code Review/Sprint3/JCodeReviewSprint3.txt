Date: 3/3/2014
Sprint Number: Sprint 3
Name of the file: Shine.cs
Author of the file: Ronit Kumar
Number of minutes spent: 20

Readability: 
	- Code is easy to read.
	- Variable names are self explanatory.

Code Quality:
	- Code length is reasonable
	- Dependency is low, low coupling
	- Cyclomatic complexity is 1, there is no branching

Hypothetical change:
	- Could declare constants for source and destination rectangle,
	  constructor requires a lot of parameter. Since Shine is a static 
	  sprite, non moving therefore location can be fixed.
