Comments: Make sure your variables are in camelCase (X_Pos -> xPos). Also, it looks like you're passing in a state to the Create function,
but be sure you are not using magic numbers. You pass in a state variable for Koopa, but not Goomba, also. 
Hypothetical Change: Since Goomba is not passed a state, how could we easily maintain his state if other variables were to change?
