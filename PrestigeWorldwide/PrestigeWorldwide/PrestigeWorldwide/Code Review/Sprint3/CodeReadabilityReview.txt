Comments: For the most part, very readable code. All variables are thoughtfully named and the class reads
easily. In the BumpedState method, however, there is a line of code:

                if (currentFrame == bumpedTotalFrames)
                {
                    currentFrame = 7;
                }

Without prior knowledge of the sprite sheet it is slightly  hard to decipher why the current frame is getting
set to a value of 7. Perhaps a comment above it explaining the purpose of this declaration would be 
useful.
